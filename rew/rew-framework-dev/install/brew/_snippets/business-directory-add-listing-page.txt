    <p><strong>Attention:</strong> We moderate all listing submissions. If your listing is not meant to be <strong>useful for our local audience</strong>, it will not be approved, so please don't waste your time. If your business is legitimately local but we think your listing is intended only for the "backlink", we will put a "nofollow" attribute on your link so that search engine benefits do not apply.</p>
