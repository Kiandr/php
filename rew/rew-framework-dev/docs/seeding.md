# Seeding data
[Phinx](http://docs.phinx.org/en/latest/seeding.html) is used to allow seeding your database with test data.

> Seed classes are a great way to easily fill your database with data after itâ€™s created. 

Our seed classes are stored in the [`database/seeds`](../database/seeds) directory.

### Demo Seeder
Need demo data to test with? There's a script for that:

```bash
$ php tools/phinx.php seed:run -s DemoSeeder
```

The [DemoSeeder](../database/seeds/DemoSeeder.php) is very simple. It just performs the MySQL queries in [`database/seeds/demo/data_crm.sql`](../database/seeds/demo/data_crm.sql). 
 
This file contains the data used to demo and test the REW CRM: [`database/seeds/demo/data_crm.sql`](../database/seeds/demo/data_crm.sql)   

### How to run a seeder class

```bash
$ php tools/phinx.php seed:run -s <SeederName>
```
